<h2>My top 3 movies of all-tima</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Time Traveler's Wife.</h3>

<p>
  This is a movie that in my opinion it's a very good movie for all of the
  family or a romantic couple.
</p>

<h3>The Amazing Spiderman</h3>

<p>I love Spiderman's movies but my favorite is acting by Andrew Garfield.</p>

<h3>Inside Out 1 or 2</h3>

<p>
  I think these two films are very special and good form, beacuse, this is a way
  to understand how the life works.
